- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

We had decided on creating a petshelter class and a pet class that extended the petshelter class. We thought that this approach would be fun and straight foward with the methods we were provided in the contract. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

In addition to the methods provided in the contract we added name, age, animaltype, breed, and time in shelter. These obviously weren't required but in order to make our shelter more interactive we thought these coulw come in handy. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The biggest problem we ran into was implementing our fly method. We tried to create an if else statement so that it would only apply to birds. However, we couldn't figure out how to get it to accept any form of the word "bird". For our statement to work the user would have to enter "bird" in all lowercase letters. We ended figuring out how to fix the problem but at first we assumed it was just a bug. For students taking this course in the future I reccomend starting early because that is what my team did and we are still barely turning it in today.
